## Auto Scaling Overview

AWS Auto Scaling helps maintain application availability and allows you to automatically adjust capacity to meet demand. It ensures that you have the right number of Amazon EC2 instances or other resources running at any given time.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Scaling**  
  Automatically increases or decreases resource capacity based on real-time metrics such as CPU utilization, request count, or custom CloudWatch metrics.

- **Scheduled Scaling**  
  Allows you to scale resources based on predictable load patterns (e.g., traffic spikes during business hours).

- **Predictive Scaling**  
  Uses machine learning to forecast future traffic and scale resources proactively.

- **Health Checks & Replacement**  
  Automatically replaces unhealthy instances to maintain application performance and availability.

- **Integration with ELB**  
  Works seamlessly with Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic across scaled instances.

- **Cost Optimization**  
  Helps reduce costs by scaling down during low demand periods and avoiding over-provisioning.

Auto Scaling is essential for building resilient, cost-effective, and responsive cloud applications that adapt to changing workloads.
