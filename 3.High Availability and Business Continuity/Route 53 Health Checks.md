## Route 53 Health Checks Overview

Amazon Route 53 Health Checks monitor the health and performance of your application endpoints to ensure reliable DNS routing and high availability.

### Key Features

- **Endpoint Monitoring**  
  Continuously checks the health of specified endpoints (e.g., web servers, APIs) using HTTP, HTTPS, or TCP protocols.

- **Automatic Failover**  
  When an endpoint becomes unhealthy, Route 53 can redirect traffic to a healthy backup resource using DNS failover.

- **Integration with CloudWatch**  
  Health check metrics can be sent to CloudWatch for alerting, visualization, and deeper analysis.

- **Configurable Thresholds**  
  Customize the number of failed checks and the interval before marking an endpoint as unhealthy.

- **Calculated Health Checks**  
  Combine multiple health checks into a single status using logical rules (e.g., majority healthy).

###  Use Cases

- High availability for web applications  
- Disaster recovery and failover routing  
- Monitoring third-party endpoints  
- Enhancing DNS-based traffic management


Route 53 Health Checks are a vital part of building resilient, fault-tolerant architectures by ensuring traffic is only routed to healthy endpoints.
