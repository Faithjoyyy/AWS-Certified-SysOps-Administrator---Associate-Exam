## Multi-AZ / Multi-Region Overview

Multi-AZ (Availability Zone) and Multi-Region deployments are architectural strategies in AWS designed to enhance fault tolerance, high availability, and disaster recovery.

###  Multi-AZ (Availability Zones)

- **Definition**: Availability Zones are isolated locations within an AWS Region. Deploying resources across multiple AZs protects against data center failures.
- **Use Cases**:
  - High availability for databases (e.g., Amazon RDS Multi-AZ)
  - Load-balanced applications with EC2 instances in multiple AZs
  - Automatic failover and redundancy
- **Benefits**:
  - Improved fault tolerance
  - Reduced latency within a region
  - Seamless failover during outages

###  Multi-Region

- **Definition**: Deploying resources across multiple AWS Regions (e.g., US-East-1, EU-West-1) for global resilience and disaster recovery.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Disaster recovery (DR) and backup strategies
  - Global applications with low-latency access for users worldwide
  - Regulatory compliance and data sovereignty
- **Benefits**:
  - Protection against regional outages
  - Enhanced performance for global users
  - Greater control over data location



Multi-AZ and Multi-Region architectures are essential for building resilient, scalable, and globally accessible cloud applications. They help ensure business continuity and minimize downtime in the face of infrastructure failures.
