## Amazon CloudWatch Overview

Amazon CloudWatch is a powerful monitoring and observability service designed for DevOps engineers, developers, and IT managers. It provides real-time insights into AWS resources and applications, helping teams maintain performance, reliability, and operational health.

###  Metrics
CloudWatch collects and tracks metrics for AWS services and custom applications. These metrics can be used to:
- Monitor resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc.)
- Track application performance
- Set thresholds for automated responses

### Alarms
Alarms allow you to set thresholds on metrics and trigger actions when those thresholds are breached. You can:
- Send notifications via Amazon SNS
- Automatically scale resources using Auto Scaling
- Trigger Lambda functions for custom remediation

###  Dashboards
Dashboards provide a customizable, visual interface to monitor metrics and alarms. Features include:
- Real-time graphs and charts
- Multi-region and multi-account views
- Custom widgets for tailored monitoring

###  Logs
CloudWatch Logs enable you to collect, monitor, and store log files from AWS services and custom applications. You can:
- Search and filter logs using powerful queries
- Create metric filters to generate metrics from logs
- Set retention policies and export logs to S3





CloudWatch is essential for building resilient, scalable, and observable cloud-native applications. It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services and supports automation for proactive incident response.
